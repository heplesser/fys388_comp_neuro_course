    "# Exercise 7: Active ion channels and a small network\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamical properties of a neuron is primarilly determined by the kinds of ion channels that it possesses, and how much it possesses of each kind. Even if two different neurons have the same set of ion channels, they may have quite different dynamical properties because some ion channels may be more abundant in one cell than in the other. In this exercise, you will work with a single compartment model with six different ion channels:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $I_{Na}$: Hodgik-Huxley-like sodium channel for action potential upstroke (conductance parameter $gna$).\n",
    "* $I_{Kdr}$: Hodgik-Huxley-like potassium channel for action potential downstroke (conductance parameter $gkdr$).\n",
    "* $I_{T}$: Low-voltage-activated calcium channel (conductance parameter $gcat$).\n",
    "* $I_{L}$: High-voltage-activated calcium channel (conductance parameter $gcal$).\n",
    "* $I_{AHP}$: Calcium-activated potassium channel causing afterhyperolarization (conductance parameter $gahp$).\n",
    "* $I_{h}$: Hyperpolarization activated general cation channel (conductance parameter $ghbar$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ion channels were taken from a model of a thalamic interneuron, and if you are interested, you can read more about them there (Halnes et al. 2011: PLoS Comput Biol 7(9): e1002160. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002160). Some of the responses that this set of ion channels can generate are shown in Figure 1. One of the ion channels, $I_{AHP}$, is not activated by voltage, but by calcium that enters through the two calcium channels $I_{L}$ and $I_{T}$. The model thus also keeps track of the intracellular calcium concentration. As concentration changes are typically slower than voltage changes, this gives the neuron a quite rich repetoire of firing properties and allows for both faster (action potentials) and slower (calcium dependent) oscillations in the membrane potential."

    "## Exercise 7.1: Firing properties of the single compartment model\n",
    "In the code below (based on Neuron and Python), you are given a template for the single compartment neuron with a set of ion channels, with parameters (maximum conductances) set so that the neuron fires as in Fig. 2 (similar voltage dynamics as in Figure 1A). Your task is to vary the conductances of the different ion channels in order to explore which of them that give rise to the different aspects of the neuronÂ´s response. Try to reproduce all the different firing patterns in Figure 1 (for the same stimulus injections, $\\pm$ 20 pA).\n",

    "\n",
    "__a)__ As a starting point, turn off the stimulus. What is the resting potential of the neuron? Does any of the active conductances affect the resting potential? What does that mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "__b)__ In Fig. 1A the neurons responds to the input current by an initial burst followed by regular AP firing. Which ion channel causes the initial burst?\n",
    "\n",
    "__c)__ Which ion channel(s) do you need to modify to make the neuron burt periodically (Fig. 1B)? Try to describe the mechanisms that underlie periodic bursting.\n",
    "\n",
    "__d)__ In Fig. 1C the neuron elicits an initial AP, followed by voltage fluctuations that are not action potentials. What ion channel(s) produce this oscillation?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "__f)__ In Fig. 1E and Fig. 1F, APs are followed by a quite strong afterhyperpolarization (negative voltage peak). In Fig. 1E the afterhyperpolarization is sharp, while in Fig. 1F it is smoother. Can you determine which ion channels that produce such sharp versus smooth afterhyperpolarizations?\n",
    "\n",
    "__g)__ The neuron in Fig. 1G is exposed to a hyperpolarizing current injection (- 20 pA). The response is an inital deep sag in the membrane potential, before the neuron (still during stimulus) settles on a somewhat less hyperpolarized voltage level. What ion channel causes this initial sag (or rather, the picks it up from it)?\n",
    "\n",
    "__h)__ When the neuron in Fig. 1G and 1F are released from the hyperpolarizing input, the membrane potential also makes a little overshoot before it settles on the resting potential. Which ion channel causes this overshoot?\n",
    "\n",
    "__i)__ When the neuron in Fig. 1F is released from hyperpolarization, the overshoot is large enough to evoke a burst of action potentials, known as a rebound burst. In addition to $I_{Na}$ and $I_{Kdr}$ for AP-generation, two ion channels are needed to produce such rebound bursts. Which two?"
